# About me
## Autobiography
Greetings,

You can call me Zaxperiment. I can program in a few programming languages and am largely self-taught.

I program to experiment with the computer's capabilities and to automate repetative tasks. As the name implies, I will be using this service to keep track of my experiments. All repositories uploaded hereafter will be experiments: none of them are intended for distribution, financial gain, or maintenance - that is not to imply that any users who happen to stumble accross this account or its contents cannot use my code for the aforementioned.

Furthermore, I intend that all code be optimised for either speed or readability. The areas which are called upon a lot will be optimised for speed; the areas that consume most of the single-run code will be clean and readable. They may or may not be annotated.

It can be expected that most code hereafter will be in C++, with some algorithms implemented in assembly and occasionally other programming languages. The content will not be generalized nor subject-specific: that is to say that there may be a kernel, boot sector, windows application, programming language, or other service randomly uploaded hereto.

Neither programming nor computer science is something I do or will do as a vocational subject. To me, the idea of spending a day staring at a screen and attemping to smite a bug out of existence is neither tempting nor appealing.

The school subjects I enjoy most are (in alphabetical order):
1. English
2. Science:
	1. Chemistry
	2. Physics
3. Mathematics

Subjects that I like are (in alphabetical order):
1. Computer Science
2. Design & Technology
3. French 
4. History (I like Geography also but will only put History up here to show my stance in the debate)

Other things I enjoy include:
1. Breathing the air outside (Id Est, going thereto)
2. Debating
3. Getting up early
4. Learning
5. Question/Querying
6. Reading
7. Running (really just not being late, I do not actively run for no reason)
8. Studying (the same thing as learning but for longer periods of time on one subject)
9. Talking
10. Keeping things clean (again: not something I actively do for no reason, but something which is necessary for my sanity)

I support formality, I might be described as a linguistic prescriptivist in some senses but I do acknowledge that people speak English in different ways. I prefer British English to American English.

The only reason for which I put what I enjoy is because I do not want to seem like one of the 'programmer stereotype.'

# Programming
## Programming Languages

The following are lanaguages I 'speak.'

### Assembly
Assembly is an incredibly fast (if you do it right) programming language that uses mnemonics (instruction names linked to opcodes) to allow machine code to be written directly in a more readable format.

I have been able to program in it for about two years. I like it because it allows me to write very quick algorithms and also to know what the Central Processing Unit is actually doing.

### C
C is an imperative (allowing you to tell the CPU somewhat what to do), procedural (non-OOP \[Object-Oritented Programming\]) programming language that allows high-level control of the hardware while also being quite direct and fast if done right.

I have been able to program in it for about 3 years. I like it because it because it allows me to do write programs quickly and also control the computer more directly.

### C++
C++ in an Object-oriented version of C++ that gives you more high-level features while also holding the power of C - it is a superset of C.

I have been able to program in it for about 2 years. I like it because it gives good features for programming in, a direct control of the system and has better documentation and support than C does nowadays.

### Java
Java is a high level language that is quite good for programming applications. I does not allow direct control of the hardware but can be used on any platform. I do not program in this programming language much anymore but could still use it.

I have been able to program in it for about 3-4 years. I like it because of its usability and abstraction.

## Intergrated Development Enviroments

The following are IDEs (Intergrated Development Enviroment(s)) that I have used and can use.

### Intellij Idea
Intellij Idea is a java IDE that is quite intelligent at figuring out where your program can be improved. I like it for that.

### Visual Studio
Visual Studio is a multi-language IDE that provides suites of features that are quite good for programming optimal, elegant code. I use this mainly.

## Development Platforms
The following are what for, I develop.
### Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
I develop, sometimes, kernels or EFI applications for UEFI to test what I can do and to experiment with bare-bones implementation of certain features.
### Basic Input Output System (BIOS)
I can develop BIOS OSs and BIOS bootloaders to do things (in a Virtual Machine as it is now deprecated).
### Windows
I can develop, using C++, Windows Portable Executables (PEs). This is the main platform I develop for as it is wherein, I code.
### Linux - Ubuntu
I have WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux) installed mainly to develop OSs and to test out things, or use packages that GNU only provide therefor.
